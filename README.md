# 2018 World Cup Memory Game

# Introduction

This project consists in a basic memory game developed with VueJS.

The problem to be solved was to consumes an external API and use this data in a interesting way.

As a soccer lover, I decided to consumes a World Cup 2018 API and develop a basic game testing your memory.

Do you have a good memory? Do you remember who won each game? We will see ;)

# How to play?

Just click on who you think won each match and advance the stages until the end.

# Why this subject?

I really love sports and I think that creating an interactive application about soccer could be interesting.

# Why this stack?

I believe that the chosen stack solves the problem in a elegant way. Furthermore, I'm trying to learn more about VueJS and the Javascript ecosystem. Maybe this test is a great opportunity to explore new skills.
